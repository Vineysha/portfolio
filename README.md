## Description

This is a professional portfolio created for the challenge in module 2. As a computer science graduate, I was motivated to create this page and be able to show potential employers my abilities and skills in this field by showcasing some of my projects. While writing this code I learned a bit of Javascript and so many different CSS functions thanks to a very useful tutorial. I created different variables to store margins, fonts, and font sizes to make it easier to remember. To conclude, it was really interesting to play with it and explore the syntax. I'm thrilled to keep adding more to this portfolio with future projects.

## Usage

Aplication URL: http://127.0.0.1:5501/index.html

In a desktop layout you'll be presented with my profile and a side menu with three options. You can scroll down to see all of my information or you can click on any of the menu options so it can take you to a specific section. There is also a mini github logo under my picture that will take you to my github profile.

In a smaller layout, you can still scroll down to see my information, but the side menu is hidden and you can see it by clicking on the three lines in the top left corner.
